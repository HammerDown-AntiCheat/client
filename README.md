# Hammer Down Anti-Cheat

**Hammer Down** is a modern anti-cheat solution designed to provide robust protection for online games against cheating and malicious activities. This project utilizes a combination of client-side protection using C++ with CodeVirtualizer and backend management powered by Go (Golang).

## Features

- **Client-Side Protection (C++)**: The client-side module is developed in C++ to ensure efficient and high-performance integration with the game. It is designed to detect and prevent common forms of cheating, including aimbots, wallhacks, and other client-side exploits.

- **Code Virtualization**: CodeVirtualizer is used to protect the client-side application from reverse engineering and tampering. This adds an additional layer of security, making it significantly harder for attackers to reverse engineer or modify the client code.

- **Backend (Golang)**: The backend is developed using Go, known for its performance and scalability. It handles server-side anti-cheat logic, player validation, and real-time data processing. The backend communicates with the client to ensure integrity during game sessions.

- **Real-Time Cheat Detection**: Hammer Down uses advanced detection methods to identify and prevent both known and unknown cheat techniques in real-time, reducing the impact of cheaters on players.

- **Minimal Performance Impact**: Hammer Down is designed to have a minimal performance impact on the client-side, ensuring that legitimate players experience a smooth gaming experience without noticeable lag or stuttering.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: While the current focus is on Windows, Hammer Down is built with cross-platform support in mind for future extensions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (MSVC or MinGW for Windows)
- Go (Golang) version 1.18+ for backend setup
- CodeVirtualizer (for client protection)



## How It Works

**Hammer Down** combines client-side and server-side detection mechanisms to ensure a high level of protection. Here's a breakdown of how it operates:

1. **Client Protection**:
    - The C++ client is protected using CodeVirtualizer to obscure the code and prevent reverse engineering.
    - The client communicates with the backend server to verify the integrity of the game session, reporting any abnormal behavior or discrepancies.

2. **Server-Side Validation**:
    - The Go backend receives requests from the client and performs various checks to detect cheating activities such as:
        - **Memory manipulation**: Detects if the clientâ€™s memory is altered.
        - **Signature scanning**: Scans for known cheat signatures.
        - **Behavior analysis**: Analyzes gameplay behavior for suspicious patterns.

3. **Real-Time Detection**:
    - The server maintains real-time communication with the client, allowing it to detect cheats as they occur and respond quickly with server-side corrective actions (e.g., banning, kicking, or reporting the player).
